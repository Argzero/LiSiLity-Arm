# LiSiLity Arm
## Unity version 2018.3.2f1 - Upper Extremity Prosthetics Simulator - Controllable via Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) 
### Upper Extremity Simulator for Unity 
#### An Argzero Project S.T.A.T.I.C. repository
[in-progress]

If you are interested in collaborating on a research project using the LiSiLity Arm, feel free to contact me at:
forrest@argzero.org

I am open to any collaboration involving publications with anyone interested and with any tools they have which are compatible with my technologies. If you have an AI / ML algorithm utilizing LSL control or which has a C#, C++, or python plugin for interfacing, your tool is likely compatible with Project STATIC.

Supported Interfaces:
- Joint Angle Inputs & Outputs
- Finger Angle Inputs & Outputs (COMPLETE)
- Hand States / Custom State Input (COMPLETE) & Output
- AZ Thermoglove (Multiplexed Thermistor Array Glove) Input (COMPLETE) and Simulated Output
- Independent Control of Both Arms (COMPLETE)
- Transradial Component (COMPLETE)
- Transhumeral Component 

Currently, only LSL inputs and outputs are supported. Planned additions:
- SQLite support (unsecure, encryption, FIPS 140-2 compliance, online/offline)
- Text file / Custom Editor file
- ROS (if deemed achievable)

NOTE: This has not been tested to work in an earlier version of Unity or later versions of Unity. To get 2018.3.2f1, please refer to the Unity download archive for the correct Unity version. I personally recommend you use the Unity Hub Beta to manage your various Unity versions, found here:
